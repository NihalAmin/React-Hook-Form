# YouTube Form Project  

## Overview  
This project consists of three different implementations of a YouTube form using React Hook Form with different validation libraries:  

1. **YoutubeForm.tsx** - Uses native validation with React Hook Form.  
2. **ZodYoutubeForm.tsx** - Implements validation using the Zod library.  
3. **YapYoutubeForm.tsx** - Implements validation using the Yup library.  

## Features  
- Form validation using different libraries.  
- Controlled and uncontrolled components.  
- Custom error handling.  
- Dynamic field handling (e.g., adding/removing phone numbers in `YoutubeForm.tsx`).  
- Auto-reset on successful submission.
